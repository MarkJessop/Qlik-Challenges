# Description:  Qlik Programming Challenge 2
#               A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
#               The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#               Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
#
# Developer notes:  Runs with a worst case of O(n^2), but optimizations make it very unlikely to reach worst case
#                   The algorithm has been written for general purpose and can be used to find other palindromes of other multiplier lengths
